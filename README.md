# Video2Text

Video2Text is a Python script that extracts audio from video files in mp3, mkv, or avi formats and saves it as text. This script uses the `moviepy` library to process video files and convert their audio content to text.

## Prerequisites

Before using Video2Text, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Python script to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.

3. Organize your video files:

   Place the video files you want to process in a directory of your choice.

4. Configure the script:

   Open the `Video2Text.py` script and modify the following variables:

   - `video_directory`: Set the path to the directory containing your video files.
   - `output_directory`: Set the path to the directory where you want to save the text files.
   - `video_formats`: Add or remove video formats as needed (default: mp3, mkv, avi).

5. Implement your audio-to-text processing (replace `audio_text` in the `extract_audio_to_txt` function):

   In the `extract_audio_to_txt` function, you should implement the audio-to-text processing logic. This is where you can use external libraries or APIs to transcribe the audio.

6. Run the script:

   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `Video2Text.py` is located, and run the script:

   ```bash
   python Video2Text.py
   ```

   The script will process the video files in the specified directory and save the extracted audio as text files in the output directory.

7. Check the output:

   After the script completes, you can find the text files with the extracted audio content in the output directory.

## Example

To get you started, the provided script extracts audio from video files and saves it as a placeholder text. You should replace the placeholder text with your audio-to-text processing logic for your specific use case.
